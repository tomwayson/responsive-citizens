This appliction was forked from [Dojo Bootstrap Map](//github.com/Esri/dojo-bootstrap-map-js), which is a configurable application template built with [Bootstrap Map](//github.com/Esri/bootstrap-map-js) and [Dojo Bootstrap](//github.com/xsokev/Dojo-Bootstrap) to create responsive mapping applications using [Bootstrap](//getbootstrap.com) components without the overhead of loading jQuery.
